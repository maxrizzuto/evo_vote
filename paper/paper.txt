Evolutionary Computing: A Solution to Partisan Gerrymandering

ABSTRACT
Gerrymandering in congressional districts is increasing in prevalence and is an enormous threat to a functioning
democracy. In such a politically-charged environment, having a non-partisan solution provides tremendous value. This
is where evolutionary computing comes in. By setting objectives with regards to competitiveness, spatial requirements,
population, and demographic data, it should be possible to create fairer congressional districts.

Existing papers have divided up the state by counties and assigned each county to a district. However, my approach
will divide the state up into evenly sized squares which contain attributes based on county data. This way, counties
can be split between congressional districts, hopefully opening the door to more effective solutions without the
constraint of unity by county.
